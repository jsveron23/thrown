Generic Error handler

```js
npm i thrown
```

Simply, we can use [Error](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Error) objects but I have published as NPM module. To reduce code and to display fancy.

Basically, you won't need this module but `thrown` have additional features to display errors fancy. You can check out from those API,
